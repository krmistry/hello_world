Experimenting, getting started

I am transitioning from a career in nonprofit fundraising and marketing into the field of quantitative ecology. Last year, I completed a certificate program in R programming, and since then I have been using R in my paid work with a medical diagnostic team as well as for school projects. I just started my first job with the job title "Research Scientist", which is very exciting. :)
